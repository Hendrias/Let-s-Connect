<center><h1>About</h1></center>
<center><p>Our website is designed to remove the difficulty in helping the impoverished. With our work, we task ourselves with finding organizations for our users to take part in, and ultimately helping the community. 
<p>By matching our client's with the business that most fufills their respective criteria, we provide an outlet for individuals to actively help their community and remove any fear around making a difference. 
<p>With Let's Connect, we hope to increase the number of African Americans above the poverty line, and to bring positive change to our community.</center>
